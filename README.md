# FT

## Load multiple ssh keys from lastpass

### Requirements
- [Lastpass cli](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli)
- Your private ssh keys stored in lastpass folder `ssh keys` as a secure note, named like:
  - your main key should be stored on a note named `id_rsa`, this key will always be loaded.
  - each of your other keys should be named following the format `id_rsa-<suffix>`, mind the mandatory `-` and make sure suffix is terse and rememberable as you'll need to type it as often as you need to load the key.
  - `.git-authors` in `$HOME`. File should be in [git-duet](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet#setup) format. This will be used to infer your lastpass email, but you can override this requirement by always specifying your lastpass account email.

### Instalation
- clone this repo and cd into it
- `chmod +x ft`
- `install ft /usr/local/bin/ft` or wherever else where and if you want it available. Somewhere in your path sounds reasonable.

### Usage
`ft <user_initials|lastpass_email> [key suffix (comma separated, no spaces)] [duration in hours]`
eg: ft user@example.org aws,linode,digitalocean 6

- If you only provide the initials/email the default (or main) key will be loaded with the default duration
- if you don't provide the duration, it will default load the keys until 6pm of that day, or 3 hours, whichever is greatest.

### FAQ

#### Q: Why `ft`?
**A:** **1)** it was available as a cli and **2)** it matches the initials of the two most common words I utter when I notice my keys aren't loaded.

#### Credits
This is basically just a multi-key version of [Waciuma's](https://github.com/waciuma4pivotal) [vkl](https://github.com/waciuma4pivotal/vkl). Thanks for having that tool available for anyone to use.
